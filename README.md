# sousmarin

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/andreiboyanov/sousmarin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/andreiboyanov/sousmarin)

All the information available on the Web about tennis players, clubs, matches and tournaments in
Belgium (starting with the francophone federation).

In this initial version the app doesn't store any information on any web server. It's only a reader for existing
Web sites like www.aftnet.be, classement-tennis.be etc. The next version will have it's own server based on the aftquery package.
